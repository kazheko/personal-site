# Contract - Tag Filtered List Page

Although the feature is served statically, we map tag list access to explicit contracts for QA alignment.

## Endpoint: GET /tags/{tag}/
- **Purpose**: Serve a list of posts filtered by the selected tag with a clear header and calm hierarchy.
- **Request**: Standard HTTP GET (no auth, no body).
- **Response**: `200 OK` with `text/html` generated by Hugo.
- **Required sections**:
  - Back link labeled "View all posts" above the page title.
  - Page title formatted as "Posts tagged with "{Tag Name}"" using the existing h1 style.
  - Tag-filtered post list rendered beneath the title with existing list hierarchy.
  - Empty state messaging if no posts are available for the tag.
- **Error states**:
  - `404 Not Found` if the tag does not exist.

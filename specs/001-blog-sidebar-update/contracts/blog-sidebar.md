# Contract - Blog Homepage Sidebar

Although this feature is static, we define contracts to make user expectations and QA explicit.

## Endpoint: GET /blog/
- **Purpose**: Serve the blog homepage with the secondary sidebar that includes the author bio and tag list.
- **Request**: Standard HTTP GET (no auth, no body).
- **Response**: `200 OK` with `text/html` generated by Hugo list templates.
- **Required sidebar sections**:
  - `Author Bio` block with author name, description, and optional secondary metadata.
  - `Tags` block listing every tag in the taxonomy.
- **Presentation rules**:
  - Section titles are uppercase labels (13px, 600 weight, 0.04em letter spacing, #6B6B6B).
  - Sidebar base text is 14px, 400 weight, 1.6 line height, #3A3A3A.
  - Tags render as compact informational chips (13px, 500 weight, 3px x 8px padding).
- **Error states**:
  - `404 Not Found` if the blog list template or content is missing (should be prevented by build verification).

## Interaction: Tag Discovery (informational)
- **Trigger**: User scans the tag list in the sidebar.
- **Contract**: Tags are visible and readable without requiring interaction; any existing tag links remain secondary in visual priority.
- **Validation**:
  - All tags in the taxonomy appear without truncation.
  - Tag styling is visibly smaller than tag treatments inside article content.

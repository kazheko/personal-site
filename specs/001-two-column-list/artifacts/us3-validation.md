# User Story 3 Validation

- Tested the list layout at 360px, 414px, 768px, and 1024px widths using browser dev tools to confirm the sidebar stacks below the post column on small screens and returns to the two-column grid at md and above.
- Verified every tag defined in site taxonomies renders exactly once with the correct post count badge; spot-checked tag links to ensure they resolve to /tags/<slug>/ pages.
- Confirmed the "No tags published yet" message appears when the taxonomy list is empty by temporarily clearing tag front matter and rebuilding the site.

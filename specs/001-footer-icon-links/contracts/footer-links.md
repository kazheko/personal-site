# Contract - Footer Social Icon Links

Although the feature is served statically, we map footer access to explicit contracts for QA alignment.

## Endpoint: GET /*
- **Purpose**: Serve pages with a footer that includes icon-only social links.
- **Request**: Standard HTTP GET (no auth, no body).
- **Response**: `200 OK` with `text/html` generated by Hugo.
- **Required sections**:
  - Footer includes icon-only links for Email, LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub when configured.
  - Each icon link includes an accessible label derived from `aria_label` or `label`.
  - Icon styling uses existing brand accent colors and hover/focus utilities.
- **Error states**:
  - Missing social link configuration omits the icon without rendering empty placeholders.

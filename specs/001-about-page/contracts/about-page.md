# Contract - About Page Delivery

Although the feature is served statically, we map user interactions to explicit contracts to keep planning/test cases concrete.

## Endpoint: GET /about/
- **Purpose**: Serve the published About page with mission copy, author bio, portrait, and CTA.
- **Request**: Standard HTTP GET (no auth, no body).
- **Response**: `200 OK` with `text/html` payload generated by Hugo using `layouts/about/single.html`.
- **Required sections**:
  - `#about` landmark containing the blog mission heading and body copy.
  - `#author` landmark containing the author heading and body copy.
  - `<figure role="img">` (or `<img>`) with `alt` text referencing the author portrait.
  - `<a class="btn-contact" href="mailto:{params.contact.email}">` rendered after text sections.
- **Error states**:
  - `404 Not Found` if the content file is missing (should be covered by build verification before deploy).

## Interaction: Mailto CTA
- **Trigger**: User activates the Contact button rendered on `/about/`.
- **Contract**: Browser opens `mailto:{params.contact.email}?subject={optional}` using the user's default client.
- **Validation**:
  - Link must include descriptive text (e.g., `Contact Yauheni`).
  - Focus ring must be visible via Tailwind `focus-visible` utilities.
  - CTA must be reachable via keyboard order immediately after the second text section.
- **Fallback**: If email client not configured, CTA should display `mailto:` address on long-press/hover via native status bar; no alternative action is introduced to keep scope constrained.

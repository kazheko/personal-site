# Contract - About Page Editorial Refresh

Although the feature is served statically, we map user access to explicit contracts to keep planning and QA concrete.

## Endpoint: GET /about/
- **Purpose**: Serve the About page with editorial spacing, updated width, and author profile styling.
- **Request**: Standard HTTP GET (no auth, no body).
- **Response**: `200 OK` with `text/html` generated by Hugo.
- **Required sections**:
  - Narrative body text rendered at 16px, 1.7 line height, and ~1.4em paragraph spacing.
  - `h2` section headings using existing styles with ~48px top margin and ~20px bottom margin.
  - Author profile block containing name, role (if present), and description text with specified colors.
  - Content wrapper constrained to 720px max width and centered on tablet/desktop, with 16px padding on mobile.
- **Error states**:
  - `404 Not Found` if `C:\home\ykazheka\personal-site\static-site\content\about\_index.md` is missing.

## Interaction: Inline links (optional)
- **Trigger**: User activates a link inside the About page narrative or author section.
- **Contract**: Link uses existing accent color and respects normal browser navigation behavior.
- **Validation**:
  - Accent color usage is limited to inline links or subtle emphasis; no new color tokens appear.
  - Focus state remains visible and uses existing Tailwind focus utilities.
